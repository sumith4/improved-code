# improved-code
This version of the function uses defaultdict from the collections module to handle the initialization of dictionary values, making the code shorter and clearer.


# unit tests

Correcting the Counting Logic: The original code incorrectly initializes new elements with a count of 0. By using defaultdict, the count is correctly initialized to 1.
Readability and Maintainability: defaultdict simplifies the code by removing the need for explicit checks and initializations, making it more readable and maintainable.
